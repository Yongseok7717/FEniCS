# Mathematical model of viscoelasticity


Dynamic vicoelastic problem of generalised Maxwell solid is represented as a second kind of Volterra integral equation with expontially decaying kernel. Let $\Omega\in\mathbb{R}^d$ be our open bounded for $d=2,3$. We have
$$ \rho\boldsymbol{u}-\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{f} $$ 
where $\rho$ is a density, $\boldsymbol{u}$ is a displacement vector, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is a stress tensor and $\boldsymbol{f}$ is an external force. The stress tensor is defined by
$$\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{D}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$$
where $\boldsymbol{D}$ is a symmetric positive definite fourth order tensor and $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is Cauchy infinitesimal strain tensor such that
$$\varepsilon(\boldsymbol u)_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}) $$
