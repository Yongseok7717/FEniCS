# Mathematical model of viscoelasticity


Dynamic vicoelastic problem of generalised Maxwell solid is represented as a second kind of Volterra integral equation with expontially decaying kernel. Let $\Omega\in\mathbb{R}^d$ be our open bounded for $d=2,3$. We have
$$ \rho\boldsymbol{u}-\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{f} $$ 
where $\rho$ is a density, $\boldsymbol{u}$ is a displacement vector, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is a stress tensor and $\boldsymbol{f}$ is an external force.
